Description
===========
Indecision is a GNOME Shell Extension which provides the ability to Drag-n-Drop indicators within the GNOME shell panel, as well as hide indicators.

The extension stores a state file, which is used on startup to arrange indicators to the user-specified position within the panel, as well as to hide any indicators previously marked to be hidden.

This extension also provides a menu for disabling/enabling installed extensions for easy access.
